# Masters Thesis Summary: 
K-edge imaging has been increasingly explored in animal models to understand how it can be useful for clinical imaging and extensive research is being made to find compatible contrast agents. More studies are needed to demonstrate its capabilities as a clinically valuable morphological and functional imaging technique alongside adequate injected contrast. 

# Deliverables
1. Write a publication manuscript on Nh-Augeurix vs. a traditional contrast agent
2. Segmented images (conventional & K-edge) and initial volume renderings at adequate windows 
3. Biodistribution calculation of segmented structures (LV, coronary arteries, pulmonary arteries, endocardium and myocardium, aorta, etc.)
4. Perfusion imaging data
5. Correlation of areas with histology and concentrations with ICP-OES
6. Thesis report and publication

# Timeline
  ## February
  A substantial amount of bibliography and work on building a SPCCT oriented visualization and image processing package for my work.
  ## March
  End of march all segmentations and biodistribution calculations should have been performed.
  ## April-May
  Correlative studies and perfusion imaging will be performed and finalized
  ## June
  By June all images and analyses should be ready for a publication.
  ## July
  Preliminary report (Jul. 4th)
  ## August
  Report deadline (Aug. 30th)
  ## September
  Thesis defense (Sep. 6)
